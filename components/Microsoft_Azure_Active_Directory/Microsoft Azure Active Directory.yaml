      Azure Active Directory is used to ensure that all passwords are cryptographically
      protected while stored and transmitted. Passwords stored by Azure Active Directory
      and locally on deployed Windows virtual machines are automatically hashed as
      part of built-in security functionality. Remote desktop authentication sessions
      are secured using TLS to ensure authenticators are protected when transmitted.


      Azure Active Directory is used to manage access to the information system. Whenever
      an account is initially created, or a temporary password is generated, Azure
      Active Directory is employed to require that the user change the password at
      the next login.

      Access to the production environment is protected from replay attacks by the
      built-in Kerberos functionality of Azure Active Directory. In Kerberos authentication,
      the authenticator sent by the client contains additional data, such as an encrypted
      IP list, client timestamps, and ticket lifetime. If a packet is replayed, the
      timestamp is checked. If the timestamp is earlier than, or the same as a previous
      authenticator, the packet is rejected.
